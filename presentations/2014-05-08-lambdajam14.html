<p>Established generic sorting is based on comparison and is known to have a lower bound of O(n log n). In a recent paper1 Fritz Henglein sets out an approach based on discrimination which has a lower bound of O(n), a fundamental improvement to the state-of-the-art. In this talk Haskell and Scala implementations of generic linear time sorting, based on this paper, will be presented. Performance measurement methodology and the initial, encouraging results will be discussed.</p>
