<p>Given Scala’s rich type-system and ability to create powerful abstractions, can we derive generic sorting based on distribution that outperforms generic comparison-based sorting? Based on the work of Fritz Henglein and Ralf Hinze, “Sorting and Searching by Distribution: From Generic Discrimination to Generic Tries” and “Generic Top-down Discrimination for Sorting and Partitioning in Linear Time”.</p>
